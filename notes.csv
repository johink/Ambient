As an experimental change for a few days, All Pick will now have 25 heroes randomly removed from the hero pool at the start of the draft before the ban phase. This change only affects Ranked Matchmaking.  In today's update we are changing how commands are processed in Dota to address some user input contention and improve responsiveness. Previously if you cast a spell and before it finished casting, you cast two spells afterwards, only the last spell would be cast. The order queue was only 1 deep effectively. This usually has no practical impact, except for things with really fast/instant cast time done in sequence. Here are a few examples of how the behavior would be different:   Axe casts  Battle Hunger. While the cast animation is playing, Axe quickly uses a  Blink Dagger and then  Berserker's Call.  Old Rules: Only  Berserker's Call is cast. The Blink Dagger order is ignored.  New Rules: Axe will use the  Blink Dagger, then cast  Berserker's Call.   Puck casts  Illusory Orb.  Puck then casts  Dream Coil. While the cast animation of Dream Coil is playing,  Puck quickly casts Ethereal Jaunt and Waning Rift.  Old Rules: Only  Waning Rift would have triggered and  Puck would not have teleported with  Ethereal Jaunt.  New Rules:  Puck teleports with  Ethereal Jaunt and then casts  Waning Rift in the new location.  This change applies generally to all orders that are issued when your hero is in another action (like during a cast animation or while stunned), and the order needs to enter the queue. Issuing a movement command or stop will still empty the queue same as before, if you decide you no longer want to issue the orders in the queue.",2017-05-31,dota2

 Picking starts after a 35 second strategy period.
 Teams alternate picking. Whenever it is a team's turn to pick, anyone on that team can pick for themselves.
 Teams have up to 30 seconds to pick a hero. If the timer expires, each player that hasn't selected a hero will lose 2 gold per second. The selection will stay on this team until a hero is picked.
 Once a selection is made, it immediately switches to the other team to pick.
 Initial starting team is random, but known at the start of the strategy period.
 If a team has not picked and continued losing gold for more than 30 seconds, a player that hasnt picked will be assigned a random hero and the turn will resume to the other team.

Dark Pact/ Kraken Shell/ Aphotic Shield/ Press the Attack/ Time Lapse no longer have a special condition for purging the following otherwise unpurgeable spells:  Poison Nova,  Heaven's Halberd,  Ensnare,  Eye of Skadi slow.  The three damage types are Physical, Magical and Pure.  Physical is affected by Physical Armor, Magical is affected by Magical Damage Resistance and Pure is affected by neither.  Magic Immunity has now been renamed to Spell Immunity. Spell Immunity only defines if Spells interact with it, not how damage itself is handled. This means that on its own Spell Immunity status does not reduce any damage.  Black King Bar, Repel, Rage and all other previous forms of ""Magic Immunity"" now grant Spell Immunity status and a 100% Magic Resistance bonus.  In the vast majority of cases, the interactions are still the same, however an example of a case that would be different is if an ability has both Spell Immunity exception and has Pure damage type. Previously the damage would not have any impact, however now it does.  Ability Tooltips now have these fields:
 Damage Type: Physical/Magical/Pure
 Pierces Spell Immunity: Yes/No  Damage Type: Physical/Magical/Pure  Pierces Spell Immunity: Yes/No  If the Damage Type is not Magical it will be colored differently to make it easier to notice. The same is true in cases where Pierces Spell Immunity is Yes.  There have been a few abilities rebalanced with these mechanics in mind. In some cases the intent is to maintain similar balance, in other cases as an adjustment to their balance.  Additional Notes:
 Composite Damage: This damage type has been removed. There are no longer any abilities which use Composite Damage.
 HP Removal: This is no longer considered a Damage Type, and its remaining uses are as an alternative cost to Mana for spells to use ( Sun Ray,  Burning Spear) or as functional HP modifications ( Armlet of Mordiggian,  Sunder, etc).

634, Removed the Three Spirits background.,2013-12-11,dota2
635, Skeleton King: Removed for pressing ceremonial reasons,2013-12-10,dota2
636, Item tooltips have been fixed.,2013-12-06,dota2
637,"Fixed a bug that caused some gem names and stat values to get truncated in the tooltip. Recipe costs have been reduced. This change will affect newly dropped recipes. Items with gems that convey the Inscribed, Autographed, and Ascendant qualities will now appear consistently. If the gemmed item already had a special quality (like Genuine) then that special quality will take precedence over the gem quality. Several issues with crafting have been fixed: A bug that made it appear that items were 'eaten' by crafting has been fixed. No items were actually eaten (they are still in your inventory). For example, a recipe that took 5 inputs would sometimes only consume 4 of the inputs and remain incomplete. The 5th item was never consumed even though it appeared to be by the UI. Recipes will now consume the correct number of items. A bug has been fixed that made the display of some recipes show the wrong type of items already fulfilled (i.e.: 4 of the same thing when actually 4 different items were fulfilled). The server is notified of a crafting attempt earlier in the crafting process so that crafting results will appear earlier. The crafting completed animation now also plays for partial crafts. A dialog will appear during a partial craft indicating the recipe is not complete and needs more components to be finalized. The tradability policy for socketed gems and crafted items has changed: Gems extracted from an item that is ""tradable after date"" now become tradable after the same date. Gems extracted from an item that can never be traded no longer inherit that restriction. You can safely add gems to a permanently untradable item without the gems becoming permanently untradable. Gems that are not tradable (like Ascendant gems) will make the item they are added to untradable, but only while those gems are socketed. Extracting the gems will remove the trade restriction from the item they are added to. If one or more crafted inputs are ""tradable after date"" then the recipe and output will become ""tradable after date"" with the latest date of the inputs. If one or more crafted inputs are permanently untradable then the recipe and output will become permanently untradable. All previously crafted items have been grandfathered into these new rules and have been made tradable.",2013-12-05,dota2
638," Added new tournament items:  The WETA Workshop in-game reward item icons (Monarch Bow, Demon Shard, Axe Practos Weapon) have been updated to show their new particle effects.

642,"Fixed -workshop command line parameter not initializing correctly (caused various issues, including not requiring particle date for items that have attached particle systems) Self-Made items can no longer be chiseled, socketed, or hammered. Gems extracted from an item that is ""tradable after date"" or ""cannot be traded"" will gain the same property. The 'you have new items' notification has had a few issues fixed. This message will also now expire after 60 seconds if ignored. The pickup items screen has been removed. New items will be shown when the user enters the armory as popups. Some issues with client item acknowledgement have been fixed that caused items to be ""invisible"" to the armory but visible in the Steam backpack. When an item is hammered and its gems extracted, the now gemless item and the extracted gems will all popup as newly found items. A bug that caused gems to get stacked on top of the item they were extracted from in the armory UI has been fixed. Items that are hidden under gems can be found by moving the gems or sorting the backpack. We are in the process of restoring items that had their original special quality (genuine, vintage, etc) changed by gems. At the moment the Inscribed, Autographed, and Ascended qualities will only be set on items that have no other special quality. The reason for a new item entering the armory is now displayed in the item drop popup, i.e.: ""Customer Support Granted You:"" or ""You Earned a Drop:"" After acknowledging a new item drop, the armory will flip to the page where the item has been placed. After closing the socketing and crafting UIs the armory will return to its original page instead of going to page 1. Added new armory filters: ""Is Equipped"" and ""Number of Sockets"" You can now preview color and effect changes in the socketing UI before committing the changes. Fixed Necrophos VO playing at half speed. Fixed Juggernaut VO not playing. Added belt slot to Pudge The Star Series 8 Prize Pool has been correctly updated to $50,000 base.

645," Couriers that scale their particle effects based on their games viewed will work again.  Fixed several bugs that caused recipes to be generated with incorrect requirements.  Fixed a bug that caused the UI for a recipe that requires multiple inputs of a particular rarity to incorrectly display a requirement for a specific item once the input requirement was partially fulfilled.  Uncraftable items will no longer be generated as required inputs for recipes. Recipes that currently have uncraftable inputs will be adjusted to require a random item of the same rarity.  Fixed a bug where inscribed gems would only display their first digit on the Steam Community Market.  Inscribed gems now are named only by the type of stat they track instead of the type of stat they track and the value. This means that all items of the same type will appear together on the Steam Community Market. I.e.: No more ""Kills: 1"" category and ""Kills: 2"" category instead there would just be one ""Kills"" category.  Roshan no longer belly aches.  Roshan refreshes hero abilities only once per life at 50%.  Roshan cannot be frozen, disarmed, or silenced.  Roshan can be stunned and hexed.  Roshan has a Spell Block ability (10 sec cooldown).",2013-11-19,dota2

The Inscribed, Autographed, and Ascendant qualities will only be applied to items that have no other quality and will be removed when the item is hammered.  Qualities that got into a weird state from gems (like missing genuine tags) will be restored this afternoon.  Heroic items will now display their tournament properties correctly.  The lava trail unusual effect should now have its correct appearance as well as an effect name.  Increased the drop rate of special rewards given for killing higher levels of Roshan to 33% per level.  All heroes are upgraded to level 25.  Your gold now counts up at 1000/sec.

Local servers allows players on the same physical network to connect to a locally hosted game.

Fixed hero alliances errors.  Fixed Smoke of Deceit being dispelled agaisnt illusions  Couriers can no longer pick up the Aegis.  Some Fog of War fixes.  Fixed a lot of pathing issues around towers  Fixed some selection issues with flying courier  Fixed a bug where characters who had model changes (such as Tiny when using Grow) would not have their selection boxes updated to match the new model.  Matchmaking is undergoing some development in the coming weeks, so games may take a little longer to fill (up to 5 minutes).  Fixed channeled abilities getting immediately interrupted if you gave an order to the unit while the unit was in the channeled ability's cast animation. The order will now be followed once the channel completes.  Now if you give an attack or move order to multiple units, any units in your selection that are currently channeling will wait for the channel to complete before executing the order, instead of interrupting the channel to execute the order immediately.  Fixed some spells with projectile dodging due to invisibility  You can now target-cast cast-attacks while disarmed (e.g. Frost Arrows while under Frost Bite).  Fixed gold values to stay at max instead of looping back to 0.  Fixed neutral selection issues  Fixed animations set while the unit was dormant not properly being transmited to the client  Changed how we do flying z-deltas, we now smoothly interpolate both up and down.  Lowered the flying height somewhat.  After a delay, heroes now sink under the ground.  You can now select which region you want to matchmake under  Shop tab reorganization. Main shop split into basics and upgrades, subtabs below that for individual pages.  You can now buy items with hotkeys. Invoking the shop with the shift key held down opens it in hotkey mode.

Fixed crash on exit.  Fixed server crash that happens if you tried to toggle your Ring of Basilius when its aura had been purged/removed (aura is also no longer purgeable).  Fixed bug that was causing Radiant-side bot pathfinding to be incorrect.  Cleaned up how lanes are selected by bots. They each now specify an affinity for the middle lane or the better-farming lane, and will handle human players in lanes better.  Bots can now still jostle for lane assignments in the first 30 seconds of a game.  Bots can now switch lanes when defending rather than locking onto the first one they decide to defend.  Bots now care more about defending buildings close to their base.  Made bots less concerned about their own self-preservation when they have a bunch of allied heroes around.  When pushing a lane that they're not in, bots now consider the lead building's backdoor protection status when deciding where to go.  Adjusted the retreat position to make sure it's inside the fountain aura range.  Reworked Roam to more closely match the desire-scoring scheme that the other abilities use. Bots will roam a bit more often now (maybe a bit too often), but will do so at smarter times towards smarter targets.  Made bots close faster on a target when a roaming hero arrives.  Fixed bug that would almost always prevent Sniper from roaming early-game.  Fixed bug that would sometimes cause bots to stand still when trying to defend a tower with lots of creeps nearby.  Fixed end-of-bot-game server crash.  Made bots slightly more likely to attack each other in 1v1 situations.",2011-09-15,dota2

Fixed the gold bounty for towers when an AI-controlled unit (lane creep) gets the last hit on a tower.  Fixed weaver swarm bugs to properly give bounty.  Fixed a pathfinding bug, mostly affecting narrow passages between trees, where a unit, from certain positions, could incorrectly consider the narrow passage blocked, thus taking a different, longer path to the destination. This also fixes certain areas where spam-right-clicking a target position would cause your character to run back and forth, such as in the tree clump below the river mid-lane.  Fixed a pathfinding bug that was preventing heroes from finding paths through certain 1-tile-wide corridors, such as among trees, when their primary path was blocked (such as by units).  Fixed a problem where if your hero was in front of an item on the ground, a shop, or a friendly unit, you would be unable to right/left-click on the object (the click would target the ground instead).  Fixed a problem where you could not right-click on items or friendly units that were behind friendly buildings.  Fixed a problem where it was difficult to right-click-attack an enemy when your selected unit was in front of the enemy.  Fixed a problem where it was difficult to left-click-select a friendly unit that was near an enemy (such as to pull back a hurt eidolon).

Prevented the camera from getting stuck when you center on the player by double tapping f1 or clicking the hero portrait.  Made right click menu ""show in shop"" appear for units that the player cannot control.  The ""grab all"" button on stash will now stack stackable items.  Fixed spectator getting an error message when pressing glyph button.  Shop: only 12 item rows, down from 14 pages of 12 items, populated when user changes tabs or search string changes.  Shop: added clear button to search box.  Added client check for trying to purchase disallowed items with the courier.  Changed sort order on healthbars: Enemy heroes will draw on top of your own.  Fixed hovering over an ability button not showing the in-game range indicator.  Ability error reporting prioritizes cooldown over lack of mana. This state is exposed in the top bar and scoreboard so we now don't show the blue out of mana indicator over the ability cooldown timer.  Fixed a problem where if you attempted to drag-query a unit but your cursor was already over the unit when you began the drag-query, the unit would be deselected when you released the mouse button.
